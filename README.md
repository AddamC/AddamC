My name is Addam Rafacho,

I'm a Software Developer currently living in São José dos Campos, Brazil. I work at Objective Solutions as a full time Salesforce Developer and Admin.

<br/>

Most of my projects are from my Bachelor days in Computer Science Bachelor, but slowly I'm planning to improve it.

My expertise as IT developer focused on web development in Java and Javascript (reactJS, Lightning Web Components), Cloud Platforms (Salesforce), as well as a variety of other Technologies on a few occasions: Python, VB.Net, Aws, Azure, Heroku, amongst others (so many technologies to follow lately lol)

You can check more about my work experience by clicking on my linkedin shortcut on top of this section.

I am into softwares focused on games and graphics outside of my work experience, although I'm yet to learn more deeply by myself.

<!-- You will see in my list of repos very different types of projects, but some that I liked where the ones with Processing and otber -->

I really like watching videos related to Game Engine/Game development (HandMadeHero, The Cherno), Browser and OS development from Andreas Kling (some really hard and niche stuff to understand lol).

Anyway, feel free to look at some of my projects, even though they are a little outdated :)
