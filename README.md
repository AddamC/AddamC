### Hello fellow visitors 👋

My name is Addam Rafacho,

I'm a Software Developer currently living in São José dos Campos, Brazil. I work at Objective Solutions as full a time Salesforce Developer and Admin.

Most of my projects consists from my Computer Science Bachelor's days, but slowly I plan to work on it.

Currently my expertise is related to working on web development with tools such as Java and Javascript (reactJS, Lightning Web Components), Cloud Platforms (Salesforce), as well as specific cases concerning a variety of other Technologies: Python, VB.Net, Aws, Azure, Heroku, amongst others (so many technologies to follow lately lol)

Some of the type of projects I really like are games and graphics related, although I'm yet to learn more deeply by myself.

<!-- You will see in my list of repos very different types of projects, but some that I liked where the ones with Processing and otber -->

I really like watching videos related to Game Engine/Game development (HandMadeHero, The Cherno), Browser and OS development from Andreas Kling (some really hard and niche stuff to understand lol).

Anyway, feel free to look some of my projects, even though they are a little outdated :)
